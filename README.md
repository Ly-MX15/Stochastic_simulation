## Code Organization in Master Branch

The master branch contains four key files, each corresponding to the individual contributions of the team members and the integrated code. Below is an overview of these files:

- **Integrated code of Assignment 1**: `Mandelbrot_Visualisation3.3.ipynb`
  - This file contains the merged and finalized code integrating all individual contributions for the assignment.
- **Q1 Thomas**: `Assignment 1 Thomas.ipynb`
  - This file includes Thomas ten Damme's work on the Mandelbrot Set for Question 1.
- **Q2 & Q3 Menghan Li**: `Mandelbrot_Visualisation3.ipynb`
  - Menghan Li's contribution covering the tasks of Question 2 and Question 3 is contained in this file.
- **Q4 Yuan Lu**: `Q4 final.ipynb`
  - Yuan Lu's implementation and optimization work for adaptive sampling in Question 4 can be found here.
